# PROJECT STATE (The Database)

> **ROLE**: This file is the Single Source of Truth for the project's macro-state.
> **RULE**: Agents must READ this at the start of a session and UPDATE it at the end of a major phase.
> **RULE**: Do NOT use this for temporary thinking (use MEMORY_STREAM.md).

## 5. File Registry (Key Artifacts)
| Document Type | Path | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brief** | `docs/project_brief.md` | ( ) |
| **Research** | `docs/research/` | ( ) |
| **Specs** | `docs/specs/` | ( ) |
| **System Model** | `docs/bmo/system_model.md` | ( ) |

## 6. Operational Tracks (Scale-Adaptive)
> **Goal**: Match effort to complexity.
- **Track A (Hotfix)**: Direct Edit.
    - *Trigger*: Bug fixes, typos, critical errors.
    - *Flow*: `05-refinement` (Targeted Fix).
- **Track B (Feature)**: Standard Flow.
    - *Trigger*: New sub-features, user stories.
    - *Flow*: `01-research` -> `02-sparc` (Proposal) -> `03-builder`.
- **Track C (System)**: Architecture First.
    - *Trigger*: Major refactors, new capabilities, cross-cutting concerns.
    - *Flow*: `01-research` -> ADR Creation -> `02-sparc` (Proposal) -> Gate Check -> `03-builder`.
