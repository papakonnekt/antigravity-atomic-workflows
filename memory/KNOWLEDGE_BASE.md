# KNOWLEDGE BASE (Long-Term Memory)

> **ROLE**: This file stores permanent lessons, established patterns, and "Laws of the Project".
> **RULE**: When a feature completes, summarize the key learnings from `MEMORY_STREAM` and append them here.
> **RULE**: Consult this BEFORE starting research to avoid repeating mistakes.

## 1. Laws of the Project (Immutable Rules)
1.  **Strict BMO Verification**: No feature is complete until `Intent` matches `Model` matches `Oracle`.
2.  **London School TDD**: Mocks are mandatory for unit tests. Isolation is key.
3.  **Multi-Arc Research**: Never accept the first solution. Compare at least two.
4.  **State Hygiene**: Read `PROJECT_STATE.md` first. Write it last.

## 2. Established Design Patterns
*(Empty - To be populated as we build)*
e.g., "All API calls must use the `useFetch` wrapper defined in `src/utils/api.ts`."

## 3. Lessons Learned (The "Pitfall" Log)
*(Empty - To be populated when things go wrong and are fixed)*
e.g., "Library X broke the build in Version 2.0; use Version 1.8 instead."
