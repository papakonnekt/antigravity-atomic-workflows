# MEMORY STREAM (Working Memory / RAM)

> **ROLE**: This is the agent's "Scratchpad" for passing context between turns and workflows.
> **RULE**: This file is highly volatile. It is wiped clean after every successful Feature Completion.
> **RULE**: Write your "Chain of Thought", "Immediate Next Steps", and "Active Context" here.

## 🔴 Immediate Attention (Hot Context)
*   **Current User Request**: "Initial Setup of the Antigravity SoTA Workflow System."
*   **Active Agent**: System Architect
*   **Status**: Setting up the file structure and core workflows.

## 🧠 Chain of Thought (Latest Reasoning)
1.  Created the directory structure.
2.  Created `PROJECT_STATE.md` to act as the persistent database.
3.  Currently creating `MEMORY_STREAM.md` to handle transient thoughts.
4.  Next: Create `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` for long-term lessons.
5.  Then: Implement `00-solicitation.md`.

## ⏭️ Next Step Queue
- [ ] Create `memory/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
- [ ] Create `.agent/workflows/00-solicitation.md`
