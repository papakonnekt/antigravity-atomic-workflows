# 04-BMO-Triangulation - Phase 4: Triangulation Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 4 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 4 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Intent (`functional_spec.md`)
2. Reality (`system_model_as_built.md`)
3. Oracle (Test Results)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Triangulation**: Do all three agree?
2. **Honesty**: Did we flag scope creep?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Input Ready
- [ ] Chaos Testing complete

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Inputs (Step 1)
- [ ] Spec loaded
- [ ] As-Built Model loaded
- [ ] Test Results loaded

### 2.2 Cognitive Triangulation (Step 2)
- [ ] **Discrepancy Check**: Spec vs Code?
- [ ] **Gap Check**: Hidden features (Scope Creep)?
- [ ] **Drift Check**: Significant structural change?

### 2.3 Reporting (Step 3)
- [ ] `docs/bmo/[feature]/triangulation_report.md` created
- [ ] **Verdict**:
    - [ ] PASS (Aligned)
    - [ ] WARN (Minor Drift)
    - [ ] FAIL (Major Discrepancy)

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Triangulation Report

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Report explicitly lists *any* deviation from Spec
