Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `failure_log.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Wisdom**: Did we look for *Verification* specific failures? (e.g. Flaky tests, State leaks)
2. **Targeting**: Did we pick a feature ready for verification?

Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]
