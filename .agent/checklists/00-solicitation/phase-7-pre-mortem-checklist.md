# 00-Solicitation - Phase 7: Pre-Mortem Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 7 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 7 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Phase 4 System Map
2. Phase 6 Knowledge Gaps

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Pessimism**: Did the agent successfully imagine failure?
2. **Breadth**: Did we consider Tech, UX, and Data failure modes?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Mental Shift
- [ ] Agent shifted context to "1 week before launch" (Future State)

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Failure Prediction (Step 1)
- [ ] Prompt used: "Imagine... project has FAILED. Why?"
- [ ] **Failure Modes Identified**:
    - [ ] Technical (e.g. "Slow DB")
    - [ ] User (e.g. "Confusing UI")
    - [ ] Process (e.g. "Scope Creep")

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 9 (Security)**: Did we identify security failures? (Data breach, etc.)

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] List of "Potential Failure Modes"

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Failure modes are specific to *this* project, not generic software risks
- [ ] At least 3 distinct failure modes identified

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 8**: Risks logged.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Optimism bias detected.
