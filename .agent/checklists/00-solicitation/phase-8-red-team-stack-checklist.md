# 00-Solicitation - Phase 8: Red Team Tech Stack Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 8 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 8 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Phase 4 System Architecture
2. Phase 3 YAGNI Constraints

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Adversarial Check**: Did the "Red Team" actually critique, or just agree?
2. **Lock-in**: Are the choices final and explicit?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Architecture Review
- [ ] Candidate stack identified from Phase 4

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Red Team vs Blue Team (Step 1)
- [ ] **Blue Team Proposal**: Ideal stack presented
- [ ] **Red Team Critique**:
    - [ ] Complexity attacked?
    - [ ] Overkill attacked?
    - [ ] Maintenance burden attacked?
- [ ] **User confirm**: User explicitly chose the path and confirmed frameworks

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 10 (Complexity Brake)**: Did the Red Team successfully kill any "Resume Driven Development" choices?
- [ ] **Law 1 (10x)**: Does the final stack allow for high-velocity dev?

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Tech Stack verified and locked
- [ ] Frameworks list is explicit (e.g. "React 18", "FastAPI", "Postgres")

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] No "TBD" in the core stack
- [ ] Versions specified where critical

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 9**: Stack locked.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Stack still debated.
