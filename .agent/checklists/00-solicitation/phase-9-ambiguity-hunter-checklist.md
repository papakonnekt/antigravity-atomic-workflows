# 00-Solicitation - Phase 9: Ambiguity Hunter Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 9 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 9 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Context with user inputs ("Fast", "Easy", etc.)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Metric Rigor**: Are metrics numbers, not words?
2. **Coverage**: Did we catch *all* the fuzzy words?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Scan
- [ ] Context scanned for trigger words: "Fast", "Easy", "Secure", "Scalable", "Robust"

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Ambiguity Elimination (Step 1)
- [ ] For each trigger word, Agent asked: "Define in measurable terms."
- [ ] **Definitions Captured**:
    - [ ] "Fast" -> [Milliseconds / Seconds]
    - [ ] "Easy" -> [Clicks / Minutes to learn]
    - [ ] "Secure" -> [Auth Standard / Encryption Level]
    - [ ] "Scalable" -> [Concurrent Users / TPS]

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 7 (Ambiguity)**: This is the core law for this phase. Zero tolerance for unmeasured adjectives.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Quantitative metrics established for all fuzzy terms

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Metrics are testable (e.g. we can write a test case for "200ms response")

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 9.5**: Metrics defined.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Still using adjectives.
