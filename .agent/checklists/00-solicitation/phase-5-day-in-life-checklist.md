# 00-Solicitation - Phase 5: Day in the Life Simulation Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 5 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 5 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Phase 4 System Map (Journey, Data, Interface)
2. Phase 2 Killer Feature (The Scenario target)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Concrete vs Abstract**: Did the simulation use specific data/clicks, or vague "user uses app"?
2. **Gap Detection**: Did the agent actually look for missing pieces?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Map Readiness
- [ ] System Map from Phase 4 is available

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Scenario Simulation (Step 1)
- [ ] **Scenario Selection**: Is the scenario for the "Killer Feature" (Core Value)?
- [ ] **Step-by-Step Flow**:
    - [ ] Entry point defined (e.g. Login, CLI command)
    - [ ] Action steps detailed
    - [ ] Success state described
    - [ ] Failure state described
- [ ] **Simulation Depth**: Agent walked through specific UI/Data interactions (e.g. "User clicks 'submit', API receives JSON...")

### 2.2 Gap Identification
- [ ] Agent explicitly looked for magic/hand-waving in the flow
- [ ] Potential API/Data gaps noted for Phase 6

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 10 (Complexity Brake)**: Did the simulation reveal unnecessary steps that can be cut?

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Simulation text exists in memory
- [ ] List of "Gaps" or "Questions" generated

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Simulation covers the "Happy Path"
- [ ] Simulation acknowledges at least one "Sad Path" (Error state)

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 6**: Scenario validated.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Simulation was too vague.
