# 00-Solicitation - Phase 2: Hindsight Visioning Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 2 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 2 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `docs/project_brief.md` (Vision Canvas)
2. `memory/PROJECT_STATE.md`
3. `Autonomy` setting (determines if we skip 5 Whys)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Value Extraction**: Did we find the *real* reason this project exists?
2. **MVP Discipline**: Is the "Killer Feature" actually minimal?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Phase Chain Check
- [ ] Phase 1.5 (Vision Canvas) must be complete
- [ ] Autonomy level checked (Fully Auto vs Manual/Semi)

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 The Time Machine (Step 2)
*(Skip if Fully Auto and skipping to derivation)*
- [ ] "Hindsight 20/20" prompt used ("Imagine 6 months from now...")
- [ ] **Killer Feature** extracted from user response
- [ ] User forced to identify ONE feature, not a list

### 2.2 The "5 Whys" (Step 3)
*(Skip if Fully Auto)*
- [ ] "Why" analysis performed on the Killer Feature
- [ ] Root Value exposed (e.g. "Efficiency" vs "Cost Savings")
- [ ] Value is deeper than just functionality

### 2.3 Super-PM: MVP Scope Scope (Integrated from PM Checklist Sec 2)
*Validate the identified "Killer Feature" against MVP standards:*
- [ ] **Minimalism (PM Sec 2.1)**: Is this feature truly the smallest thing that delivers value?
- [ ] **Problem Fit (PM Sec 2.1)**: Does it directly address the Problem defined in Phase 1?
- [ ] **Feasibility (PM Sec 2.2)**: Is it realistic for the agent to build this?

### 2.4 Super-PM: UX Requirements (Integrated from PM Checklist Sec 3)
*Check implied UX:*
- [ ] **User Flow (PM Sec 3.1)**: Is the primary flow for the Killer Feature clear?
- [ ] **Accessibility (PM Sec 3.2)**: Are there obvious accessibility blockers in this feature? (Flag if yes).

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 1 (The 10x Engineer)**: Does the Killer Feature have leverage?
- [ ] **Law 4 (One-Shot Principle)**: Can we build this in logical chunks?

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Killer Feature identified and logged in current context
- [ ] Core Value identified and logged in current context

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Killer Feature is specific (e.g. "One-click deployment" vs "Easy to use")
- [ ] Core Value explains the "Why"

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 3**: Value is clear.
- **RETRY PHASE**: "Killer Feature" is actually a list of 10 things.
