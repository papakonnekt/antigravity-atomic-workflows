# 00-Solicitation - Phase 6: Knowledge Gap Audit Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 6 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 6 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Phase 5 Simulation Results
2. `memory/PROJECT_STATE.md` (to check against knowns)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Honesty**: Did the agent admit what it doesn't know?
2. **Specificity**: Are the gaps actionable research items?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Simulation Review
- [ ] Phase 5 Scenario reviewed for "Magic"

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Gap Analysis (Step 1)
- [ ] **Input Review**: "Magic" steps from Phase 5 identified
- [ ] **Gap Listing**: Unknowns listed explicitly (e.g. "Unknown API rate limits", "Undefined schema for User")
- [ ] **Categorization**: Are these technical unknowns or requirements unknowns?

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 7 (Ambiguity)**: This phase exists to KILL ambiguity. Ensure no vague "explore stuff" items.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] List of Knowledge Gaps (Unknowns)

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Gaps are phrased as questions or missing data points
- [ ] List is not empty (unless project is trivial)

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 7**: Gaps identified.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Deep unknowns ignored.
