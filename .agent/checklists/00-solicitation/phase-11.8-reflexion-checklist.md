# 00-Solicitation - Phase 11.8: Reflexion Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 11.8 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 11.8 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `memory/MEMORY_STREAM.md`
2. `memory/EPISODIC_MEMORY.md`
3. `memory/HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Learning**: Did we actually learn something new?
2. **Documentation**: Is the memory updated for the *next* agent?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]
