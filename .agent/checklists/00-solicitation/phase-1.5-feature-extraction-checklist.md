# Phase 1.5 Checklist: Feature Extraction (Collaborative)

- [ ] **Context Hydrated**: Read Vision from `PROJECT_STATE.md` at start.
- [ ] **Recursive Loop**: Engaged in at least one cycle of "Suggest -> Confirm".
- [ ] **Proactive Suggestions**: Agent suggested features/libs the user didn't explicitly mention.
- [ ] **Real-Time Updates**: `feature_inventory.md` was updated (or drafted) during the loop.
- [ ] **Granularity Check**: Features are decomposed (Function + Form + Tech).
- [ ] **"Anything Else?"**: Asked the user if they had more ideas before closing the loop.
- [ ] **Final Approval**: User explicitly approved the "Locked Feature Inventory".
