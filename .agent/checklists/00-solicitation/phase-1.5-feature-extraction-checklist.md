# Phase 1.5 Checklist: Feature Extraction (Deep Dive)

- [ ] **SCoT Analysis**: Used Structured Chain of Thought to decompose the user's prompt (Mental Process visible).
- [ ] **Atomic Decomposition**: Broken down "Big Concepts" into atomic, buildable features.
- [ ] **Tech Stack Identified**: Languages, Frameworks, and Databases explicitly listed or asked about.
- [ ] **Library Audit**: Specific libraries (e.g., Axios vs Fetch, Zod) identified or asked about.
- [ ] **Form & Function**: Every feature has a defined Look (Form) and Logic (Function).
- [ ] **Clarification Loop**: Asked user about ambiguous terms ("Fast", "Modern", "Secure").
- [ ] **User Verification**: Presented the full inventory to the user and received "YES".
- [ ] **Documentation Created**: `docs/feature_inventory.md` exists and is deeply populated.
- [ ] **Zero Ambiguity**: No "TBD" items left in the inventory.
