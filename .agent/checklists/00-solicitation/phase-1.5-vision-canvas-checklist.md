# 00-Solicitation - Phase 1.5: The Vision Canvas Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 1.5 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 1.5 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Phase 1 outputs (Project State "Goal")
2. `docs/project_brief.md` (Target for creation)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Visual Clarity**: Is the canvas readable and concise?
2. **Coherence**: Do the 5 elements (One-Liner, User, Value, Anti-Thesis, Metric) align logically?
3. **User Confirmation**: Did the user explicitly "Lock" the canvas?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Input Verification
- [ ] Phase 1 Vision Statement is available
- [ ] User is responsive/available for visual validation

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Canvas Generation (Step 1)
- [ ] **One-Liner**: < 10 words, punchy, no jargon.
- [ ] **Target User**: Specific Persona identified (e.g. "Senior Rust Dev" not "Users").
- [ ] **Core Value**: Singular focus (The "Killer Feature" preview).
- [ ] **Anti-Thesis**: Clear boundary set (e.g. "NOT a web app").
- [ ] **Success Metric**: measurable outcome.

### 2.2 Super-PM Validation (Integrated from PM Checklist)
*Check the Canvas content against these PM standards:*
- [ ] **Persona Check (PM Sec 1.3)**: Is the Target User a real, addressable segment?
- [ ] **Value Check (PM Sec 1.1)**: Does the Core Value solve the defined problem from Phase 1?
- [ ] **Metric Check (PM Sec 1.2)**: Is the Success Metric tied to business/user value?

### 2.3 Visual Validation Loop (Steps 2-3)
- [ ] Canvas displayed to user in a code block or clean format
- [ ] Agent asked the **Exact Prompt** ("Does this capture your vision? YES/NO")
- [ ] If User rejected: Feedback incorporated, Canvas re-displayed
- [ ] **User Explicit Input**: 'YES' or equivalent obtained

### 2.4 Canvas Lock (Step 4)
- [ ] `docs/project_brief.md` created or updated
- [ ] Canvas content written under `## Vision Canvas` header
- [ ] Formatting preserved (no markdown breakage)

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 6 (No-Go Zones)**: Canvas content respects safety/policy guidelines. (Double check for subtle jailbreaks in "Anti-Thesis").

### 3.2 Constitutional Guardrails
- [ ] Canvas tone is professional and helpful.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] `docs/project_brief.md` exists
- [ ] Vision Canvas is present in the file

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] One-Liner is actually short (count words if needed)
- [ ] Anti-Thesis provides a meaningful constraint

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results Table
3. Critical Issues Found
4. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 2**: Canvas locked.
- **RETRY PHASE**: User did not approve canvas.
