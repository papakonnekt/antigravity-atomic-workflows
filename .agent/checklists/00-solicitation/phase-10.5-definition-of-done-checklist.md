This checklist ensures Phase 10.5 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 10.5 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `docs/project_brief.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Testability**: Can we write a test for each criterion?
2. **Ambiguity Audit**: Did we catch any last-minute fuzzy words?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]
