# 02-SPARC-Specification - Phase 5: Functional Spec Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 5 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 5 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `user_stories.md`
2. `edge_cases.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Precision**: Are types defined? (No `any`).
2. **Completeness**: Are functions named?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Input Ready
- [ ] Edge cases ready

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Interface Design (Step 1-2)
- [ ] Persona shifted to "Systems Engineer"
- [ ] **Specs Defined**:
    - [ ] File names?
    - [ ] Function/Class names?
    - [ ] Input/Output Types (TypeScript Interfaces)?

### 2.2 Writing (Step 3)
- [ ] `memory/openspec/changes/[feature]/specs/functional_spec.md` created
- [ ] **Content Check**:
    - [ ] Signatures match Requirements?

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 15 (Zero Slop)**: No placeholder code.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Functional Spec with Types

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] No `any` types used in interfaces

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 5.5**: Spec written.
- **RETRY PHASE**: No types defined.
