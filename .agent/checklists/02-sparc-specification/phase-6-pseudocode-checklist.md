# 02-SPARC-Specification - Phase 6: Pseudocode Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 6 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 6 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `functional_spec.md`
2. `edge_cases.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Logic**: Is the pseudocode logical or just comments?
2. **Simulation**: Did the agent run a mental sandbox?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Input Ready
- [ ] Spec ready

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Literate Programming (Step 1)
- [ ] `pseudocode.md` created
- [ ] Logic written in plain English (Literate)

### 2.2 Mental Sandbox (Step 2)
- [ ] **Simulation Run**: Logic tested against Edge Cases in "Mind's Eye"
- [ ] **Correction**: Logic flaws fixed *before* final commit
- [ ] **Null Check**: Explicit handling of missing data verified

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 5 (SCoT)**: Thinking before doing.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Valid Pseudocode

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Pseudocode handles at least one edge case explicitly

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 7**: Logic verified.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Logic is buggy.
