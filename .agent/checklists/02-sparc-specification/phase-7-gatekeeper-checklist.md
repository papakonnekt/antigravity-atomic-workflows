# 02-SPARC-Specification - Phase 7: Gatekeeper Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 7 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 7 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. All Staging Artifacts (Stories, Spec, Pseudocode, Edge Cases)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Coverage**: Is everything connected?
2. **Promotion**: Did we copy files to the correct location?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Staging Ready
- [ ] All files exist in `memory/openspec/changes/...`

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Traceability Matrix (Step 1)
- [ ] **Check 1**: Spec satisfies Stories? (100% Map)
- [ ] **Check 2**: Pseudocode handles Edge Cases?
- [ ] **Check 3**: ADR exists (if needed)?

### 2.2 Decision & Promotion (Step 2-3)
- [ ] **Decision**: PASS (No gaps)
- [ ] **Action**:
    - [ ] `memory/openspec/changes/[feature]/specs/` content COPIED to `docs/specs/[feature]/`
    - [ ] Promotion verified (Files exist in destination)

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 16 (Handoff)**: Ensuring only valid specs move forward.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Files in `docs/specs/`

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] No orphaned requirements (Story exists but no Spec function)

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 8**: Specs Promoted.
- **LOOP BACK**: Gaps found.
