# 02-SPARC-Specification - Phase 8: Mirror Test Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 8 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 8 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `docs/specs/[feature]/` (Promoted Specs)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Sanity**: Did we promote garbage?
2. **Quality**: Last check before code.

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Promotion Check
- [ ] Files exist in `docs/specs/...`

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 The Mirror Test (Step 1)
- [ ] **Critique Performed**:
    - [ ] No `any` types remaining?
    - [ ] Edge cases are real failures?
    - [ ] User Stories are testable?

### 2.2 Scoring (Step 2)
- [ ] Score > 9/10 achieved?
- [ ] **If < 9**: IMMEDIATE RE-SPEC (Loop back)

### 2.3 Wisdom (Step 3)
- [ ] Success logged to `memory/failure_log.md`

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 15 (Zero Slop)**: Clean specs = Clean code.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] High Quality Spec confirmed

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 9**: Spec Verified.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Spec is trash.
