# 02-SPARC-Specification - Phase 0: Ancestral Audit Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 0 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 0 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `memory/failure_log.md`
2. `memory/PROJECT_STATE.md`
3. `memory/MEMORY_STREAM.md` (For Hotfix check)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Specificity**: Did we look for *Spec* failures, not just generic ones?
2. **Mode-Awareness**: Is Hotfix logic applied?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Context Check
- [ ] Prerequisites verified (Constitutional Check)

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Wisdom Retrieval (Step 1)
- [ ] `memory/failure_log.md` reviewed
- [ ] Failures specific to *Specifications* identified (e.g. "Undefined Types", "Missed Edge Cases")
- [ ] 3 Constraints listed to prevent recurrence

### 2.2 Mode Check (Step 2)
- [ ] `MEMORY_STREAM` scanned for "HOTFIX_REQUEST"
- [ ] **Decision Made**:
    - [ ] HOTFIX MODE (Target specific fix -> Phase 1 limited scope)
    - [ ] NORMAL MODE (Proceed to Phase 1 full scope)

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 11 (Episodic Memory)**: Consulting the past.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Constraints generated
- [ ] Mode selected

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Constraints are actionable (e.g., "Always specify JSON schema for APIs")

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 1**: Spec Audit done.
- **REDIRECT**: Hotfix engaged.
