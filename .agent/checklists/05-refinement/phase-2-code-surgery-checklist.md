This checklist ensures Phase 2 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 2 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Source Code
2. Fix Plan

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Precision**: Did we change ONLY what was needed?
2. **Synchronization**: Did we update specs if needed?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]
