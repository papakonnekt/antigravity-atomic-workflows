# 03-London-TDD-Builder - Phase 0: Ancestral Audit Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 0 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 0 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `memory/failure_log.md`
2. `memory/PROJECT_STATE.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Wisdom**: Did we check for past *Build* failures?
2. **Focus**: Did we pick ONE feature?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Context Check
- [ ] Prerequisites verified (Constitutional Check)

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Wisdom Retrieval (Step 1)
- [ ] `memory/failure_log.md` reviewed
- [ ] failures specific to *Builder* workflow identified (e.g. "Bad Mocks", "Import Errors")
- [ ] 3 Constraints listed to prevent recurrence

### 2.2 Job Hunt (Step 2)
- [ ] Feature selected with status `(S)`
- [ ] Feature status updated to `(B)` (Building)
- [ ] **Constraint**: Only ONE feature selected.

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 14 (State)**: Project state updated before work begins.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Constraints generated
- [ ] Feature selected & state updated

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Constraints are actionable (e.g. "Use absolute imports")
