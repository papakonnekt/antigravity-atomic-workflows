# 03-London-TDD-Builder - Phase 2: Implementation Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 2 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 2 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `src/[feature].ts`
2. Test Suite

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Minimalism**: Did we write *just enough* to pass?
2. **Success**: Are tests Green?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Input Ready
- [ ] Tests Red

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Coding (Step 3)
- [ ] Source code written/updated
- [ ] **Constraint**: Minimal implementation (No Gold Plating)

### 2.2 The Green Loop (Step 4-5)
- [ ] `npm test` executed
- [ ] **Result**:
    - [ ] GREEN (All pass) -> Proceed
    - [ ] RED -> Debug Loop

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 15 (Zero Slop)**: No placeholder logic unless strictly temporary.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Code Code
- [ ] Green Test Suite

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Pass is genuine (not `expect(true).toBe(true)`)

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 2.5**: Tests passed.
- **LOOP**: Tests still failing.
