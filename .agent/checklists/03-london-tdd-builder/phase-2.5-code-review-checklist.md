# 03-London-TDD-Builder - Phase 2.5: Code Review Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 2.5 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 2.5 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. Implemented Code (Phase 2)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Pedantry**: Nitpick variable names and types.
2. **Intent**: Does the code actually do what the test asks?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Context Check
- [ ] Tests are Green

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Clean Code Audit (Step 2)
- [ ] **Naming**: No `data`, `item`, `res`?
- [ ] **Types**: No `any`?
- [ ] **Cruft**: No commented out code?
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: Named constants used?
- [ ] **Docs**: JSDoc/Docstrings present?

### 2.2 Logic Verification (Step 3)
- [ ] Code satisfies test intent (not gaming the test)
- [ ] Code is simple/readable

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 7 (Ambiguity)**: Clear naming.
- [ ] **Law 15 (Zero Slop)**: Professional quality.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs

### 4.2 Quality Standards

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
