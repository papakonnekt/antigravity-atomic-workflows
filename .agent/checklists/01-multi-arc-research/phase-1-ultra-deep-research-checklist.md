# 01-Multi-Arc-Research - Phase 1: Ultra-Deep Research Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 1 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 1 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `memory/PROJECT_STATE.md` (Features to research)
2. `docs/research/` directory

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Depth**: Did we actually run 5 passes, or just one generic search?
2. **Structure**: Is the output in SCoT format?
3. **Budget**: Did we stay under 40k tokens?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Strategy Check
- [ ] Phase 0.5 (Meta-Strategy) complete

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Multi-Pass Search (Step 1.1)
*Verify that valid searches were performed for EACH pass:*
- [ ] **Pass 1 (Official)**: Docs/Release notes found?
- [ ] **Pass 2 (Sentiment)**: Reddit/GitHub Issues checked?
- [ ] **Pass 3 (Comparative)**: Alternatives evaluated?
- [ ] **Pass 4 (Patterns)**: Code examples found?
- [ ] **Pass 5 (Edge Cases)**: "Gotchas" explicitly searched?

### 2.2 SCoT Output Generation (Step 1.3)
*Check `docs/research/[feature]/deep_dive.md` content:*
- [ ] **Step 1 (Definition)**: Present?
- [ ] **Step 2 (Value)**: Present?
- [ ] **Step 3 (Version Lock)**: **CRITICAL**. Is a specific version number listed?
- [ ] **Step 4 (Install)**: Exact command?
- [ ] **Step 5 (Patterns)**: Minimal working example?
- [ ] **Step 6 (Gotchas)**: Warnings listed?
- [ ] **Step 7 (Alternatives)**: Listed?
- [ ] **Step 8 (Recommendation)**: Final verdict?

### 2.3 Token Budget (Step 1.4)
- [ ] File size checked (< 40k tokens approx 160kb text)
- [ ] If too large: Summarization or Appendix moves performed

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 5 (SCoT)**: The Structure IS the law here.
- [ ] **Law 3 (No Hallucinations)**: Citations/Links present?

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] `deep_dive.md` exists
- [ ] All 8 SCoT steps present for key techs

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Version numbers are current (2025/2026)
- [ ] "Gotchas" are not empty

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 1.5**: Research deep.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Surface level only.
