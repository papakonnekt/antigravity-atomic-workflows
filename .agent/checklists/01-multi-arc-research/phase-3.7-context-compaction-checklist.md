# 01-Multi-Arc-Research - Phase 3.7: Context Compaction Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 3.7 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 3.7 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `docs/research/[feature]/deep_dive.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Compression**: Can the research be defined in one sentence?
2. **Cleanup**: Is the short-term memory cleared?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Input Ready
- [ ] Deep Dive available

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Synthesize Nugget (Step 1)
- [ ] **The Nugget**: < 50 words summarizing key tech decision.
- [ ] Rationale included.

### 2.2 Memory Updates (Step 2-3)
- [ ] `memory/MEMORY_STREAM.md` updated with Nugget
- [ ] `memory/run_command_log.json` (mental scratchpad) effectively cleared/marked processed

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 11 (Episodic Memory)**: Efficient storage of knowledge.

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Nugget in Memory Stream

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Nugget is retrievable and meaningful

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 3.8**: Context compacted.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Nugget too verbose.
