[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 4 CHECKLIST (MANDATORY LOOP)

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: This is an EXIT PHASE.
You MUST:

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `memory/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
2. `memory/schemas/handoff_schema.json`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Schema Compliance**: JSON matches `handoff_schema.json`.
2. **Artifact Integrity**: Does `deep_dive.md` exist and look complete?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]
