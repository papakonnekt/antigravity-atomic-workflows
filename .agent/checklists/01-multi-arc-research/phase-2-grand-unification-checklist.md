# 01-Multi-Arc-Research - Phase 2: Grand Unification Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 2 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 2 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. New Deep Dive (Phase 1)
2. All previous `docs/research/`
3. `docs/architecture/system_architecture_manifest.md`

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Holism**: Did we look at the whole system, not just the new feature?
2. **Conflict Sensitivity**: Did we purposefully look for breaks?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Read-All
- [ ] All research files loaded into context

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Graph of Thought Analysis (Step 2)
- [ ] GoT Protocol applied
- [ ] **Nodes**: Key findings identified
- [ ] **Edges**: Connections to existing system drawn
- [ ] **Conflict Check**:
    - [ ] Any "CONFLICTS_WITH" edges?
    - [ ] Conflicts resolved (Refactor vs Reject)?

### 2.2 Synthesis (Step 3)
- [ ] `system_architecture_manifest.md` created or updated
- [ ] Updates reflect the *unified* view (Old + New)

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 11 (Episodic Memory)**: Ensuring consistency over time.
- [ ] **Law 2 (Conway)**: Does the unified architecture still fit the team structure (Agent)?

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Coherence Report (GoT output)
- [ ] Updated Manifest

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Manifest is not a "append-only" log; it's a synthesized document

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 3**: Unified.
- **RETRY PHASE**: Conflicts ignored.
