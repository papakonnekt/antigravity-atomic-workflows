# 01-Multi-Arc-Research - Phase 0: Ancestral Audit Checklist

This checklist ensures Phase 0 is executed completely, correctly, and in alignment with the workflow's Global Laws and objectives.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PHASE 0 CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to:
1. `memory/failure_log.md`
2. `memory/PROJECT_STATE.md`
3. `memory/MEMORY_STREAM.md` (For Hotfix check)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Mode Detection**: Did we correctly identify if this is a Hotfix or Normal run?
2. **Wisdom**: Did we actually read the failure log?

EXECUTION MODE:
Option A: Interactive - Complete section by section with user confirmation
Option B: Autonomous - Execute full phase and report at end]]

## 1. PREREQUISITES & CONTEXT

### 1.1 Context Check
- [ ] Prerequisites verified (Constitutional Check)

## 2. CORE PHASE EXECUTION

### 2.1 Wisdom Retrieval (Step 1)
- [ ] `memory/failure_log.md` read
- [ ] Specific *Research* failures identified (e.g. Hallucinations)
- [ ] 3 Constraints listed to prevent recurrence

### 2.2 Mode Check (Step 2)
- [ ] `MEMORY_STREAM` scanned for "HOTFIX_REQUEST"
- [ ] **Decision Made**:
    - [ ] HOTFIX MODE (Redirect to 05-refinement or specific fix)
    - [ ] NORMAL MODE (Proceed to Phase 1)

## 3. QUALITY GATES

### 3.1 Global Law Compliance
- [ ] **Law 11 (Episodic Memory)**: Are we using the past to inform the present?

## 4. EXIT CRITERIA VALIDATION

### 4.1 Mandatory Outputs
- [ ] Constraints generated
- [ ] Mode selected

### 4.2 Quality Standards
- [ ] Constraints are relevant to Research (e.g. "Double check API versions")

## PHASE VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: FINAL PHASE REPORT GENERATION
1. Phase Status: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / FAILED
2. Validation Results
3. Next Phase Readiness: READY / BLOCKED]]

### Validation Results
| Section | Status | Issues |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1. Prerequisites | _TBD_ | |
| 2. Core Execution | _TBD_ | |
| 3. Quality Gates | _TBD_ | |
| 4. Exit Criteria | _TBD_ | |

### Phase Decision
- **PROCEED TO PHASE 1**: Ready.
- **REDIRECT**: Hotfix detected.
