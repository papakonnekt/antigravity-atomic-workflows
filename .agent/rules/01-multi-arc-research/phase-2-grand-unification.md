# Phase 2: The Grand Unification (GoT Synthesis)

> **Parent Workflow**: 01-Multi-Arc-Research
> **Phase Number**: 2
> **Objective**: Ensure new research fits with old research (Conflict Detection).

---

## Prerequisites
**MUST be completed before this phase**:
- ✅ Phase 1: The "Deep Dive" Paper (covering all arcs)

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read EVERYTHING
**Action**: Read all files in `docs/research/` (including previous features) and the new Deep Dive Paper.

### Step 2: Cross-Impact Analysis (Graph of Thought)
**Constraint**: Use **Graph of Thought Protocol** (Law 11) to check for systemic consistency.
1.  **Nodes**: Represent each major finding found in the Deep Dive as a node.
2.  **Edges**: Draw "CONFLICTS_WITH" or "ENHANCES" edges to existing `PROJECT_STATE` features.
3.  **Analysis**:
    - **If Conflict Detected**: Trace the causal chain. Is the new research wrong, or is the old system outdated?
    - *Action*: If the old system prevents necessary progress, mark for **Refactor**. If the new research is incompatible for no good reason, **Reject** strategy.
4.  **Output**: A coherence report.

### Step 3: Synthesis
**Action**: Create/Update `docs/architecture/system_architecture_manifest.md` based on the unified graph.

### Step 4: Phase Checklist
**Action**: Open `.agent/checklists/01-multi-arc-research/phase-2-grand-unification-checklist.md`.
**Instruction**: Verify every item is checked.

## Exit Criteria
**This phase is complete when ALL of the following are true**:
- ✅ Cross-Impact Analysis passed via GoT.
- ✅ Architecture Manifest updated.
- ✅ Checklist verified.
