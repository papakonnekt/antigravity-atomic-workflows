## Prerequisites
**MUST be completed before this phase**:
- ✅ Phase 2: The Grand Unification

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: The Mirror Test
**Action**: Read your `deep_dive.md`.
**Critique**:
- "Did I use any 'Banned Words'?"
- "Did I include specific versions?"
- "Did I find at least one 'Gotcha'?"
- "Did I use 'Lazy' imports?"
- "Did I explicitly state the dependencies?"
- "Is the 'Hybrid Strategy' actually a chimera (bad idea)?"

### Step 2: Scoring Decision
- **Score < 9/10**: "Research too shallow. I must dig deeper." (Loop back to Phase 1).
- **Score > 9/10**: Proceed to Exit.

### Step 3: Wisdom Recording
**Action**: Append to `memory/failure_log.md`: "Research [Feature] successful. Key learning: [Insight]."

### Step 4: Phase Checklist
**Action**: Open `.agent/checklists/01-multi-arc-research/phase-3-mirror-test-checklist.md`.
**Instruction**: Verify every item is checked.
