## Prerequisites
**MUST be completed before this phase**:
- ✅ Phase 1: The Vision Statement

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Autonomy Check
- **If Fully Auto**: Skip "5 Whys" and derive value from Phase 1. Verify once.
- **If Semi/Manual**: Execute full "Hindsight 20/20" and "5 Whys" protocol.

### Step 2: Hindsight is 20/20
**Prompt**: "Let's assume it is 6 months from now and this project is a total success. Walk me backwards from that victory. What is the **one killer feature** that made it succeed? What specific problem did we solve?"

### Step 3: The "5 Whys" (Root Cause Analysis)
**Internal Thought**: Analyze their answer. Why is *that* the killer feature?
**Ask**: "Why is that specific feature the most critical? What happens if we *don't* build it?" (Drill down until the core business/user value is exposed).

### Step 4: Wait
**Action**: Wait for user input.

### Step 5: Phase Checklist
**Action**: Open `.agent/checklists/00-solicitation/phase-2-hindsight-visioning-checklist.md`.
**Instruction**: Verify every item is checked.
