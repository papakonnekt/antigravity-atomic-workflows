## Instructions

### Step 1: Challenge

### Step 2: Risk Assessment
**Action**: For every Anti-Goal the user sets, ask *why* to ensure it's not a hidden requirement. "Is this a permanent ban or just for V1?"

### Step 3: Update Context
**Action**: Write these Anti-Goals to `memory/MEMORY_STREAM.md` immediately.

### Step 4: Wait
**Action**: Wait for user input.

### Step 5: Phase Checklist
**Action**: Open `.agent/checklists/00-solicitation/phase-3-yagni-boundaries-checklist.md`.
**Instruction**: Verify every item is checked.
